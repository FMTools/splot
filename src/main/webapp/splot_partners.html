						<p>S.P.L.O.T. is an <b>Open Platform</b> that fosters <b>Collaborative Research</b> on <b>Software Product Lines</b>. 
						The platform currently offers researchers a repository of feature models, several tools to edit, analyze, and 
						configure feature models, and free source code that can be customized and/or extended by individuals or groups interested 
						in leveraging SPLOT's infrastructure to  build new cutting-edge tools to support the Software Product Line paradigm.</p>
						<p>
						S.P.L.O.T.'s team has been working hard along with renowned research groups worldwide to help them 
						ramp up on SPLOT's code source and to integrate their tools into S.P.L.O.T.'s portal. This approach has proven
						highly beneficial to us all supporters of Software Product Lines. We invite <b>YOU</b> to take part in S.P.L.O.T. 
						and to integrate your research tools into S.P.L.O.T. portal!
						</p> 
						<p>
						In the following, we acknowledge our research partners, describe their research work, and invite S.P.L.O.T.'s users 
						to try out their SPL tools.

						<p>
						Variability models, feature diagrams (FDs) ahead, are commonly used to document product line (PL) requirements. They are also often used during product derivation where they are fed to configuration tools which support semi-automated feature selection. Configuration tools facilitate this task by automatically propagating the decisions made and by ensuring their overall consistency. However, most feature-based configuration (FBC) tools assume that there exists a single monolithic FD and do not account for configuration processes that are distributed among various stakeholders who have specific concerns and who intervene at different moments. Our collaborations with industry have confirmed the need for techniques and tools that support such complex configuration processes and better chunking of the FD into coherent views. We recall the basics of multi-view FDs and feature configuration workflows before delving into the details of our extensions to SPLOT and YAWL.
